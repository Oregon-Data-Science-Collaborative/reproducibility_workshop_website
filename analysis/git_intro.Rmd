## Git for version control 

Version control keeps files organized and tracks changes over time, making it  
easier for you to reproduce your analyses and to step backward/’undo’ changes as  
needed during the analysis process.  

### Learning objectives

The target audience for this workshop is any researcher looking to improve their  
basic skills with Git. During this workshop, participants will  

- Gain familiarity with Git commands, vocabulary, and basic workflows
- Practice using Git to track changes and recover older file versions
- Use both the command line and a Git client

### Sources
This lesson is adapted in part from the [Software Carpentries][] and [Library Carpentries][] lessons.

Other useful resources for learning Git include:

[Happy Git with R][] - especially useful if you are an R user and new to Git.  
[Think Like a Git][] - I found this most useful once I had some basic Git knowledge
[Git Cheatsheet][] - some basic and some more advanced commands

Slides presented during the workshop are available here and give more conceptual  
background into using Git for version control.

## Getting started

*Make sure you've downloaded Git and made a GitHub account before the workshop.  
You'll use the same email used for your GitHub account to configure Git on your 
machine.*

### Configure Git

The first time you use Git on your computer, you will need to configure some settings,  
including your name and email address. It's useful to use the same user name and  
email you will use with GitHub (or other Git host server, such as GitLab). 

It's also helpful to use the `global` flag to configure these settings for all  
Git activity on this computer on your user account. 

`$ git config --global user.name "Your Username"`  
`$ git config --global user.email "Your email"`

It's also useful to configure your preferred text editor to use with Git.  
To set the text editor to nano on Mac or Linux, use: 

`$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`

Check out the [table]() from Software Carpentries for setting other text editors.

Finally, configure the name of the default branch to `main`.

`$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

Check the status of your git settings with the `list` option:

`$ git config --list`
