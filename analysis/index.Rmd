Demo text

This website accompanies a series of workshops that introduce tools and practices
for conducting reproducible research with quantitative data. Topics covered 
include principles of reproducible workflows, using Git for version control and
GitHub for collaboration, and best practices for project management. Researchers
at any level are welcome; no programming experience is needed but basic familiarity
with a coding environment (R, Pyton, Matlab) will be helpful. The workshops are 
presented in sequence but can be attended independently.
