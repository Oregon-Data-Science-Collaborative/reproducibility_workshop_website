## Git and GitHub for Collaboration

While version control with Git enhances reproducibility, GitHub takes it to the  
next level by facilitating collaboration. In this workshop, participants will  
practice collaborating on GitHub, including pushing and pulling changes to a  
shared repository. We will also explore some of GitHubâ€™s additional functionality  
(e.g. using Issues) that can support scientific teams.

### Learning objectives 

The target audience for this workshop is any researcher looking to improve their  
use of GitHub for sharing and collaborating on research projects. Basic familiarity  
with Git, including using the command line and/or a Git client, is needed.  
However, we will cover the basics of syncing Git and GitHub. 

During the workshop, participants will

- Practice pushing and pulling changes to a remote repository
- Set up and make changes in a shared and collaborative repository
- Consider different kinds of GitHub workflows to facilitate collaboration
