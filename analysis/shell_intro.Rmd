## Working in the shell

This is a brief introduction to working in the shell, to supplement the live-coding during the workshop. 

This guide is derived in part from the [Sofware Carprentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) lessons on using the shell.

### Getting started

When you open the shell, you will see some **text** followed by a **prompt symbol** and a **text cursor**.  

The text indicates your user name and the working directory (the folder you are working in).  

The prompt symbol is often a `$` but may also be a `%` depending on the shell you are using.  

The cursor indicates where you can begin typing commands.  

After you type a command, hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to run the command.  

The command `echo` will display a line of text. If you type the following and hit enter  
`$ echo hello!`  
you should see the **output** on the next line as  
'hello!'
