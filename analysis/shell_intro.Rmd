## Working in the shell

This is a brief introduction to working in the shell, to supplement the live-coding during the workshop. 

This guide is derived in part from the [Sofware Carprentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) lessons on using the shell.

### Getting started

When you open the shell, you will see some **text** followed by a **prompt symbol** and a **cursor**.  

The text indicates your user name and the working directory (the folder you are working in).  

The prompt symbol is often a `$` but may also be a `%` depending on the shell you are using.  

The cursor indicates where you can begin typing commands.  

After you type a command, hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to run the command.  

The command `echo` will display a line of text. If you type the following and hit enter  

`$ echo hello!`  

you should see the **output** on the next line as  

`hello!`

<p class="text-success">
In this documentation, the `$` prompt is included but you don't need to type the
prompt itself, just the commands that follow it.</p>

Some other basic commands:

`pwd` prints the working directory (the folder you are working in)  

`ls` returns a list of files in the current (working) directory  

`clear` will scroll up your screen to give you a clean space to work it. This makes it easier to read, 
but you can still scroll up to see your previous work.

Try running `ls` to see the files in your directory.

### Options and documentation

When you run a command, you can add **options** (also known as **flags**) to modify the output.  

For example, use the option `-l`  for the command `ls` to display more information.

`$ ls -l` 

To find out what options are available for a command, access the manual (i.e. the documentation) 
by running `man` and the command:  

`$ man ls`

gives as output the manual for the `ls` command. 

You can navigate through the manual using the <kbd>&#x2191;</kbd> and <kbd>&#x2193;</kbd>
arrow keys, <kbd>page up</kbd> and <kbd>page down</kbd>, or <kbd>space</kbd> and <kbd>B</kbd>.  

Type <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the manual.

Note, on a Windows machine running Git Bash, you may need to use the `--help` option 
instead of `man` to access documentation. 

### Environment variables

**Environment variables** are pieces of information that are stored in your shell session.
Variables start with `$`, e.g. the variable `$USER` identifies the user (you).  

Access variables individually using the echo command:

`$ echo $USER`

returns your username.

You can access all environment variables using `env` and you can set 
environment variables using `export`.

`$ export greeting=hello`

returns no output to the console but saves the variable value. Access the new value 
with the `echo` command:

`$ echo $greeting`

Exiting and opening a new session of the shell will reset the variables.

### Navigating files and directories

You may be used to navigating the file system using Finder or Windows Explorer.
